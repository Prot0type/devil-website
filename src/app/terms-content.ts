<h3 class="font-bold text-pink-600 mb-2">ARTICLE I &mdash; PREAMBLE &amp; RECITALS</h3>

<p class="mb-2">WHEREAS, Devil has been scientifically and empirically observed to be hopelessly, irrevocably, and embarrassingly in love with Piggies;</p>

<p class="mb-2">WHEREAS, Piggies has been found to possess an unreasonable amount of cuteness, the magnitude of which has been documented to cause involuntary smiling, random heart palpitations, and the uncontrollable urge to give forehead kisses;</p>

<p class="mb-2">WHEREAS, the Parties have been engaged in a continuous, ongoing, and non-terminable relationship characterized by excessive use of pet names, inside jokes that make no sense to third parties, and an alarming consumption of snacks;</p>

<p class="mb-2">WHEREAS, it has come to the attention of the First Party that February 14th is, according to generally accepted calendar standards, Valentine&rsquo;s Day;</p>

<p class="mb-4">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants, and conditions herein, and for other good and valuable consideration (including but not limited to: hugs, forehead kisses, and letting Devil pick the movie sometimes), the Parties agree as follows:</p>

  <li><strong>&ldquo;Snack Run&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; shall mean any unplanned excursion to procure food items, initiated at any hour of the day or night, without regard to whether a meal was recently consumed. The initiating Party shall not be judged.</li>
  <li><strong>&ldquo;The Look&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; shall mean that specific facial expression made by Piggies that renders Devil completely unable to say no to any request, regardless of how unreasonable said request may be.</li>
  <li><strong>&ldquo;Movie Night&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; shall mean an event during which both Parties spend forty-five (45) minutes selecting a film, twelve (12) minutes watching said film, and the remainder of the evening looking at their phones while pretending to watch.</li>
  <li><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Fine&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; shall NOT mean that the Party is, in fact, fine. The other Party is hereby required to investigate further with no fewer than three (3) follow-up questions and one (1) offering of chocolate.</li>
  <li><strong>&ldquo;Five More Minutes&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; shall be interpreted as a period of time ranging from twenty (20) minutes to three (3) hours. This applies to sleep, shopping, and &ldquo;just one more episode.&rdquo;</li>

<p class="mb-2">Devil hereby agrees to the following obligations, effective immediately and without expiration:</p>

<ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
  <li>To love Piggies on good days, bad days, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it&rdquo; days, and especially on &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry and everything is annoying&rdquo; days.</li>
  <li>To provide a minimum of five (5) compliments per day, which may include but are not limited to: &ldquo;You look cute,&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best thing that happened to me,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yes, that outfit looks amazing.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>To serve as the official spider remover, jar opener, and &ldquo;what was that noise&rdquo; investigator of the household.</li>
  <li>To never, under any circumstances, finish the last piece of Piggies&rsquo; favorite snack without explicit written consent (a text message shall suffice).</li>
  <li>To always share the blanket, even when it is objectively cold and Devil is also freezing. Piggies&rsquo; warmth takes priority as per Section 7.2(b) of the Universal Relationship Code.</li>
  <li>To remember important dates including but not limited to: anniversaries, birthdays, the day they first met, the day of their first date, and the day Piggies showed Devil that one really funny meme.</li>
  <li>To provide unlimited back scratches, head pats, and hand-holding services upon request, with a guaranteed response time of no more than thirty (30) seconds.</li>
  <li>To always take Piggies&rsquo; side in public, even if Devil privately believes Piggies may be slightly, marginally, imperceptibly wrong (which, for the record, has never happened).</li>
  <li>To sit through any movie, TV show, or video that Piggies wants to watch, without complaint, sighing, or checking the remaining runtime more than twice.</li>
  <li>To always say &ldquo;you pick&rdquo; when asked where to eat, and then to not veto more than two (2) of Piggies&rsquo; suggestions.</li>
</ol>

<p class="mb-2">Piggies hereby agrees to the following terms:</p>

<ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
  <li>To continue being the most adorable person in Devil&rsquo;s life. (This is non-negotiable and has been the status quo since Day One.)</li>
  <li>To accept compliments without deflecting, arguing, or saying &ldquo;no, YOU&rsquo;RE cute&rdquo; (although this response is also acceptable under Subsection 3.1 of the Cute Response Addendum).</li>
  <li>To tolerate Devil&rsquo;s jokes, including the bad ones, the dad jokes, and the ones that are told for the fourteenth time.</li>
  <li>To continue stealing Devil&rsquo;s hoodies, as it has been established that they look better on Piggies anyway.</li>
  <li>To allow Devil to stare at Piggies with a dopey smile without asking &ldquo;what?&rdquo; more than once per occurrence.</li>
  <li>To agree that Devil is, in fact, the funniest person Piggies knows (or at minimum, to laugh politely).</li>
  <li>To be patient with Devil on days when Devil is grumpy, tired, or making less sense than usual.</li>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
  <li>To never go to bed angry, unless both Parties are too sleepy to resolve the issue, in which case the matter shall be tabled until morning and resolved over coffee/tea.</li>
  <li>To always root for each other, hype each other up, and be each other&rsquo;s biggest fan, loudest cheerleader, and most biased supporter.</li>
  <li>To maintain a shared queue of shows/movies, and to NEVER watch ahead without the other Party (violations of this clause shall result in dramatic betrayal speeches lasting no less than ten (10) minutes).</li>
  <li>To hold hands in public, in private, in the car, on walks, and whenever the opportunity presents itself.</li>
  <li>To have at least one (1) proper date night per month, which may range from a fancy dinner to sitting on the floor eating pizza &mdash; the venue is irrelevant; the company is what matters.</li>
  <li>To communicate openly, honestly, and with the understanding that neither Party is a mind reader (though Piggies is suspiciously good at it).</li>
  <li>To support each other&rsquo;s dreams, goals, and ambitions, even the weird ones, especially the weird ones.</li>
  <li>To always say &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; before hanging up the phone, leaving the house, or going to sleep. No exceptions. Not even if you&rsquo;re running late.</li>

  <li><strong>Medium Disputes</strong> (e.g., whose family to visit first, thermostat settings): Shall be resolved through calm discussion, with both Parties acknowledging that Piggies is probably right.</li>
  <li><strong>Major Disputes</strong> (e.g., whether a hot dog is a sandwich): Shall be tabled indefinitely, as some questions are too dangerous to answer.</li>
  <li>In the event of any disagreement, both Parties agree that a hug lasting no less than twenty (20) seconds shall be administered before any further discussion takes place.</li>
  <li>The use of &ldquo;The Look&rdquo; (as defined in Article II) during dispute resolution is permitted but acknowledged as an unfair advantage.</li>

  <li>Any attempt to terminate this Agreement shall result in an increase in affection levels by a factor of ten (10x), rendering termination functionally impossible.</li>

  <li><strong>Amendments:</strong> This Agreement may be amended at any time by mutual consent, typically communicated through a long hug and the phrase &ldquo;okay fine, you win.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is found to be &ldquo;too cheesy,&rdquo; such provision shall still be enforceable because cheesiness is a feature, not a bug.</li>
  <li><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> This document constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior agreements, text conversations at 2 AM, and pinky promises (which are still sacred and separately enforceable).</li>
  <li><strong>Governing Law:</strong> This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of love, the rules of kindness, and the principle that Piggies is always right.</li>
  <li><strong>Notices:</strong> Any notice required under this Agreement may be delivered via text, voice note, handwritten letter, sticky note on the fridge, or a dramatic declaration in person.</li>
